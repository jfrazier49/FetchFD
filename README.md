# Welcome to my take on the Fetch Frontend assignment

To first run this assignment please install npm

Now, please run
1. Please run npm install
2. Run npm run dev or run start (either opens the application)

You have now successfully opened the application! 
Since we weren't given too much time to work on the user experience, I didn't get to implement a lot of heavy CSS and overall effects to make it look nice, however I added a functioanlity where user can select up to 1-10 pictures per breed.

Thank you again!
